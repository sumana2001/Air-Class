<h2>Introduction for the video</h2>
<p>Air Class, your virtual instructor and companion is here to provide assistance in academics as well as martial arts for you, with the luxury of staying indoors.
It uses the technology of Augmented Reality.
Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that exist in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.</p>


<h2>How it can help the community</h2>

<ul>
<li>It will help students to learn and understand complex working and diagrams with the power of AR</li>
<li>It helps parents and students create a healthy combination of learning and gaming</li>
<li>It eliminates the need of physical classroom</li>
<li>It will encourage people to take care of their health and fitness.</li>
<li>It will provide guidance to women in self-defence.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>A person who wants to get information on a specific topic can click on it and the instructor will provide explanations with pictorial representation. </br>
 For example, if a person wants to learn about the human heart, he or she can select the topic. The teacher will proceed to explain about it in detail with a 3D model of the human heart.</p>

<p>To maintain a healthy combination of learning and breaks, a person can use our quiz and gaming options available, where a person can test their knowledge in a fast track interactive quiz and if they score well, a gaming option becomes available. Thereby helping a person gain constant motivation to do better.</p>
